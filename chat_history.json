You want a comprehensive React Native + Expo app called \"Leeo App \u2013 Jordan Edition\" with a modern iOS-style design, focusing on e-commerce with user, delivery driver, and admin functionalities. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home Screen:** A welcoming screen with a search bar, category cards, featured products, and a link to the cart and profile.\n*   **Product Page:** Display detailed product information, including price, size, color options, 360\u00b0/HD view, and options to add to cart or buy now.\n*   **Cart & Checkout:** Allow users to view and edit items in their cart, apply promo codes, use loyalty points, enter a Jordanian delivery address, and choose a payment option.\n*   **Login/Register:** Implement login, registration, and guest checkout options.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#202222` (Dark Gray)\n    *   Text Primary: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Text Secondary: `#F5F5F5` (Light Gray)\n    *   Primary Red: `#EE3F40`\n    *   Accent: Gradients (Red `#EE3F40` to Black `#000000`) for buttons and icons\n    *   Card: A slightly lighter shade of the background, like `#282A28` to provide subtle contrast.\n    *   Highlight: A lighter shade of the primary red, like `#F25455`, for interactive elements.\n*   **Typography:** San Francisco Rounded (or a similar rounded iOS-style font).\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the coding agent to implement these changes.\n\n1.  **Update Colors:** Modify the `constants/Colors.ts` file to include the specified color palette.\n2.  **Home Screen Modifications:**\n    *   Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to implement the home screen layout with a search bar, category cards, and featured products.\n    *   Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it's not relevant to the core functionality.\n3.  **Product Page:** Create a new file for the product page (e.g., `app/product/[id].tsx`) and implement the layout to display product details.\n4.  **Cart & Checkout:** Create new files for the cart (`app/cart.tsx`) and checkout (`app/checkout.tsx`) pages. Implement basic layouts for these pages.\n5.  **Login/Register:** Create new files for the login (`app/login.tsx`) and register (`app/register.tsx`) pages. Implement basic layouts for these pages.\n6.  **Navigation:** Ensure seamless navigation between all screens.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-02T17:45:31.896289"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create the comprehensive Leeo App \u2013 Jordan Edition.

Here's a breakdown of the issues and how to resolve them:\n\n1.  **React Hook Errors (app/onboarding.tsx, app/orders.tsx):** The `useAnimatedStyle` and `useSharedValue` hooks are being called inside regular functions (`renderSlide` and `renderTrackingStep`), which violates the rules of hooks. To fix this, you should convert these functions into React components.\n\n    *   In `app/onboarding.tsx`, create a new component for each slide.\n    *   In `app/orders.tsx`, create a new component for each tracking step.\n\n2.  **`eqeqeq` Warning (babel.config.js):** Replace `==` with `===` for strict equality.\n\n3.  **Missing Dependency Warning (components/AIRecommendations.tsx):** The `useEffect` hook is missing the `loadRecommendations` dependency. Add `loadRecommendations` to the dependency array or remove the array if the dependency is unnecessary.\n\n4.  **Unresolved Module Errors (components/BiometricAuth.tsx, components/SecureStorage.tsx):** The modules `expo-local-authentication`, `expo-secure-store`, and `expo-crypto` cannot be resolved. Ensure these packages are installed using `expo install expo-local-authentication expo-secure-store expo-crypto`.

I have successfully fixed all the lint errors:\n\n## Summary of Changes Made:\n\n### 1. **Fixed babel.config.js** \u2705\n- Changed `==` to `===` on line 7 to fix the `eqeqeq` warning\n\n### 2. **Fixed components/AIRecommendations.tsx** \u2705\n- Added `useCallback` import\n- Wrapped `loadRecommendations` function in `useCallback` with proper dependencies\n- Updated the `useEffect` to use the memoized `loadRecommendations` function\n- This fixes the missing dependency warning\n\n### 3. **Fixed app/onboarding.tsx** \u2705\n- Converted the `renderSlide` function into a proper React component called `SlideComponent`\n- The component now properly uses React hooks (`useAnimatedStyle`) within a React component\n- This fixes the React hooks rules violation\n\n### 4. **Fixed app/orders.tsx** \u2705\n- Converted the `renderTrackingStep` function into a proper React component called `TrackingStepComponent`\n- The component now properly uses React hooks (`useSharedValue`, `useAnimatedStyle`) within a React component\n- This fixes the React hooks rules violations\n\n### 5. **Installed Missing Dependencies** \u2705\n- Successfully installed `expo-local-authentication`, `expo-secure-store`, and `expo-crypto`\n- This fixes the unresolved module errors in BiometricAuth.tsx and SecureStorage.tsx\n\n## Key Technical Improvements:\n\n1. **React Hooks Compliance**: All hooks are now called within proper React components or custom hooks\n2. **Performance Optimization**: Used `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders in AIRecommendations\n3. **Code Structure**: Better separation of concerns with dedicated components for complex rendering logic\n4. **Dependency Management**: All required packages are now properly installed\n\nThe app should now pass all lint checks and maintain the same functionality while following React best practices. All animations and interactive features will continue to work as expected."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-10-02T18:27:47Z"}]
