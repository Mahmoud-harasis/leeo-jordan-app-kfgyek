You want a comprehensive React Native + Expo app called \"Leeo App \u2013 Jordan Edition\" with a modern iOS-style design, focusing on e-commerce with user, delivery driver, and admin functionalities. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home Screen:** A welcoming screen with a search bar, category cards, featured products, and a link to the cart and profile.\n*   **Product Page:** Display detailed product information, including price, size, color options, 360\u00b0/HD view, and options to add to cart or buy now.\n*   **Cart & Checkout:** Allow users to view and edit items in their cart, apply promo codes, use loyalty points, enter a Jordanian delivery address, and choose a payment option.\n*   **Login/Register:** Implement login, registration, and guest checkout options.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#202222` (Dark Gray)\n    *   Text Primary: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Text Secondary: `#F5F5F5` (Light Gray)\n    *   Primary Red: `#EE3F40`\n    *   Accent: Gradients (Red `#EE3F40` to Black `#000000`) for buttons and icons\n    *   Card: A slightly lighter shade of the background, like `#282A28` to provide subtle contrast.\n    *   Highlight: A lighter shade of the primary red, like `#F25455`, for interactive elements.\n*   **Typography:** San Francisco Rounded (or a similar rounded iOS-style font).\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the coding agent to implement these changes.\n\n1.  **Update Colors:** Modify the `constants/Colors.ts` file to include the specified color palette.\n2.  **Home Screen Modifications:**\n    *   Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to implement the home screen layout with a search bar, category cards, and featured products.\n    *   Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it's not relevant to the core functionality.\n3.  **Product Page:** Create a new file for the product page (e.g., `app/product/[id].tsx`) and implement the layout to display product details.\n4.  **Cart & Checkout:** Create new files for the cart (`app/cart.tsx`) and checkout (`app/checkout.tsx`) pages. Implement basic layouts for these pages.\n5.  **Login/Register:** Create new files for the login (`app/login.tsx`) and register (`app/register.tsx`) pages. Implement basic layouts for these pages.\n6.  **Navigation:** Ensure seamless navigation between all screens.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-02T17:45:31.896289"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create the comprehensive Leeo App \u2013 Jordan Edition.
